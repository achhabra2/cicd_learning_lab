* If the command above gives the error `Error: you must provide the Drone server address.`, you likely closed the terminal window after the Environment Prep step.  Run these commands to reset the environment variables.

    ```
    export DRONE_SERVER=http://DRONE_SERVER
    export DRONE_TOKEN=<your token>
    ```
